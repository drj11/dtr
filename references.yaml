  note: |
    Looks like a pretty thorough survey of DTR in the US, and in
    particular its annual cycle.  Discusses relationship with
    other meteorological elements (such as snow and precipitation),
    which is interesting but not directly applicable to our purpose.
    Uses daily data.  And ancient datasets.

  note: |
    Looks thorough.  Should read.  Looks like it might use GHCN-M for DTR.
    Uses daily data (synoptic Tmin and Tmax extracted from NCAR DS464.0) for correlation analysis with
    surface humidity, moisture, wind, cloud, precipitation.  Uses gridded monthly Tmin and Tmax (from GHCN v2)
    for cloud and precipitation correlation on decadal time scales.

  note: |
    Defines DTR as monthly TMAX - monthly TMIN.  Quite interesting so far.
    Notable for the assembling of national collections into a dataset
    covering the Northern hemisphere (and a less than representative portion
    of the Southern hemisphere).  Analysis is regional, seasonal, and
    mostly restricted to 1950 onwards (by availability of data).  Discusses
    possible influence of urbanisation, irrigation, and desertification on
    the long term change in Temperature Range.  Regress DTR**0.5 against
    various synoptic climate variables.  The justification for the square
    root (p1017) seems rather hand-wavy (explanatory power goes from 53%
    without square root to 55% with square root.  hah!).  Concludes that
    some changes in DTR may be attributable to cloud cover changes,
    possibly anthropogenic, but more modelling is necessary.

    worth reading.
    Uses monthly Tmin Tmax data, specifically, CRU TS 2.0 (ah really? CRU TS 2.0 publishes DTR directly).
    Comparison to GCMs.  Land mask for areas with reasonable converage.
    GCMs do not accurately portray decedal trends in DTR.  Possibly cloud
    modelling is the problem.

    WARNING: I've only got the NOAA summary, not the GRL print or pre-print.
    Short (3 pages).  Data from GHCN-M and GHCN-D, WWR, and a bunch of national collections.
    Mins Maxs and DTRs.  With a nice coverage map.
