# A Reminder on how to calculate Diurnal Temperature Range.

# Abstract

We find that in many published studies
the methods used to calculate diurnal temperature range (DTR)
are not always specified (in particular
for monthly averages of DTR), or are specified only implicitly.  In light
of this, we study the differences that arise between two reasonable
choices of method.  In this study, the methods lead to values for
monthly average DTR that may differ by more than 2 K.  We find that for
many stations the distribution of the differences is not symmetric and
there is an average bias between the two methods.  This bias is present
even when entire networks are considered.  Some stations may exhibit an
artificial trend in monthly DTR that is due to choice of method.

# Intro

Daily Temperature Range is XX [description here, and why it is
climatologically interesting].  DTR is not a directly observed quantity,
it is derived from measurements of TMIN and TMAX (the minimum and maximum
temperature obtained in a day).

## Paragraphs not yet placed

[KARLETAL1993] suggest that it may be worth considering more precise
technique to calculate DTR (on p1017).

Method M.  Daily maximum temperature is averaged into a monthly TMAX;
daily minimum temperature is averaged into a monthly TMIN.  Monthly DTR
is then computed as TMAX-TMIN.  Note that it is easy to use Method M on
collections of monthly data (such as GHCN-M, USHCN).

Method D.  Each day's minimum temperature is subtracted from its maximum
temperature to produce a daily DTR series.  The daily DTR series is then
averaged into a monthly DTR.  Note that Method D requires that reasonable
quality daily data be available.

[KARLETAL1993] uses monthly data; [BRAGANZAETAL2004] uses monthly data;
[VOSEETAL2005] uses monthly data.  [DAIETAL1999] uses a mixture of daily
and monthly data (but when considering monthly averages, appears to use
Method M).  Clearly when the data has already been compiled into monthly
averages, only Method M can be used.

When averaging daily (temperature) values into monthly values, it is
usual to apply some sort of completeness check.  The ideal situation
would be when there are no missing daily values, but requiring this may
lead to the elimination of monthly values when there are in fact enough
daily data to compute a reasonable monthly average. WMO recommends that a
monthly value should not be computed when there are more than 10 missing
days or 5 or more missing consecutively (section 4.8.4 of [WMO100]).
For 30-year normals the stricter 3/5 rule is recommended [WMOTD341]:
no more than 5 missing days and no more than 3 missing consecutively in
any month.

Quality.  5 stations in the UK have clear discrepencies in a
multi-year period in the decade starting in 2001 for the TMIN element.
The remaining UK station does have a long enough period for this
analysis.  Consequently all UK stations in the GSN are discarded from
this analysis.  Brief visual checks of all the stations (temperatures
and anomalies for both TMIN and TMAX) were made; no further stations
were discarded.

To illustrate the effect, see figure [XX work/b19401.png], a plot of
TMAX and TMIN for GHCN-D station USW00026615 year 1949, month January.
Circles mark days where TMAX is valid and TMIN is not valid (4 days), and
days where TMIN is valid and TMAX is not valid (3 days).  For each series
the missing days are isolated, so would still pass the WMO 3/5 rule.
It so happens that in this month the days when TMIN is valid but TMAX is
not are cold, and the days when TMAX is valid but TMIN is not are warm.
The difference in the result of the two different methods for calculating
Daily Range is 2.4 â„ƒ.

While more workers may be choosing to do analyses with daily
data series, it is still the case that due to their simplicitly,
availability, and manageability, some workers may prefer working
with monthly data series.  We urge compilers of monthly data series
to publish (quality controlled) monthly averages of DTR.  This is
the simplest way that workers can avoid the hazard of using TEXS.
Datasets that are compiled primarily from underlying daily data
(USHCN GHCNM) should be able to do this most easily.
