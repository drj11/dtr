# A Reminder on how to calculate Diurnal Temperature Range.

## Paragraphs not yet placed

[KARLETAL1993] suggest that it may be worth considering more precise
technique to calculate DTR (on p1017).

When averaging daily (temperature) values into monthly values, it is
usual to apply some sort of completeness check.  The ideal situation
would be when there are no missing daily values, but requiring this may
lead to the elimination of monthly values when there are in fact enough
daily data to compute a reasonable monthly average. WMO recommends that a
monthly value should not be computed when there are more than 10 missing
days or 5 or more missing consecutively (section 4.8.4 of [WMO100]).
For 30-year normals the stricter 3/5 rule is recommended [WMOTD341]:
no more than 5 missing days and no more than 3 missing consecutively in
any month.

Quality.  5 stations in the UK have clear discrepencies in a
multi-year period in the decade starting in 2001 for the TMIN element.
The remaining UK station does have a long enough period for this
analysis.  Consequently all UK stations in the GSN are discarded from
this analysis.  Brief visual checks of all the stations (temperatures
and anomalies for both TMIN and TMAX) were made; no further stations
were discarded.

Figure [XX work/b19401.png] illustrates the effect.  GHCN-D station
USW00026615 year 1949, month January.  Note that 3 days have no valid
TMAX, and 4 days have no valid TMIN (but in both cases, the missing days
are isolated, so would still pass the WMO 3/5 rule).
It so happens that in this month
the days when TMIN is valid but TMAX is not are cold, and the days when
TMAX is valid but TMIN is not are warm.  The difference in the result
of the two different methods for calculating Daily Range is 2.4 ℃.

While more workers may be choosing to do analyses with daily
data series, it is still the case that due to their simplicitly,
availability, and manageability, some workers may prefer working
with monthly data series.  We urge compilers of monthly data series
to publish (quality controlled) monthly averages of DTR.  This is
the simplest way that workers can avoid the hazard of using TEXS.
Datasets that are compiled primarily from underlying daily data
(USHCN GHCNM @@) should be able to do this most easily.
