# A Reminder on how to calculate Diurnal Temperature Range.

# Abstract

We find that in many published studies
the methods used to calculate diurnal temperature range (DTR)
are not always specified (in particular
for monthly averages of DTR), or are specified only implicitly.
In light of this, we study the differences that arise between two
reasonable choices of method.  In this study, the methods lead to
values for monthly average DTR that may differ by more than 2 K.
We find that for many stations the distribution of the differences is
not symmetric and there is an average bias between the two methods.
This bias is present even when entire networks are considered.
Some stations may exhibit an artificial trend in monthly DTR that
is due to choice of method.

# Intro

Daily Temperature Range (DTR) is the range over which temperature
varies during a day.  It is usually defined as $$ TMIN - TMAX $$
where TMIN is the minimum temperature in a day, and TMAX is the
maximum temperature in a day.  In this study we are only concerned
with measurements of land surface air temperatures.

It is common in climate studies to use monthly averages of various
climate elements.  For TMIN and TMAX the monthly average is usually
made available in compilations of monthly climate data.  However,
DTR is usually not (for example, it is not published in GHCN-M or
USHCN [MENNEETAL2009]).

Consider two methods for copmuting a monthly average for DTR:

Method M.  Daily maximum temperature is averaged into a monthly TMAX;
daily minimum temperature is averaged into a monthly TMIN.  Monthly DTR
is then computed as TMAX-TMIN.

Method D.  Each day's minimum temperature is subtracted from its
maximum temperature to produce a daily DTR series.  The daily DTR
series is then averaged into a monthly DTR.

Note that it is easy to use Method M on collections of monthly data
(such as GHCN-M, USHCN); this makes Method M attractive as
monthly data is often easier to obtain and may have already been
through a reasonable quality assurance process.  In contrast 
Method D requires access to daily data; there is often more
daily data, but it can be harder to access, there may be
unreasonable volumes of it, and it may only have had no, or only
minimal, quality checks applied.

In an observing network it is desirable to compile monthly
averages from a complete set of days.  Inevitably however, there
may be some days where an element is not reported.  Clearly when
there are no missing days in a particular month, then Method M
and Method D will compute the same value for the monthly average
DTR.  However, if there are days when TMIN is reported but TMAX
is not (or vice versa) then the two methods may compute
different values.

To illustrate the effect, see figure [XX work/b19401.png], a plot
of TMAX and TMIN for GHCN-D station USW00026615 year 1949, month
January (after flagged data have been removed).  Circles mark days
where TMAX is valid and TMIN is not valid (4 days), and days where
TMIN is valid and TMAX is not valid (3 days).  For each series the
missing days are isolated, so would still pass the WMO 3/5 rule.
It so happens that in this month the days when TMIN is valid but
TMAX is not are cold, and the days when TMAX is valid but TMIN is
not are warm.  The difference in the result of the two different
methods for calculating DTR is 2.4 â„ƒ.

In practice we find studies use monthly data when assessing DTR:
[KARLETAL1993] uses monthly data; [BRAGANZAETAL2004] uses monthly data;
[VOSEETAL2005] uses monthly data.  [DAIETAL1999] uses a mixture of daily
and monthly data (but when considering monthly averages, appears to use
Method M).  Clearly when the data has already been compiled into monthly
averages, only Method M can be used. [DURREWALLACE2001] uses daily data,
the Summary of the Day First Order (FSOD) from the National Climatic
Data Center.

# Methods

We use daily data from Global Climate Observing System Surface
Network (GSN) [PETERSONETAL1997] stations that are in GHCN-D
[MENNEETAL2012].  All data flagged by the GHCN-D automated quality
assurance procedures [DURREETAL2010] are removed before processing.

## Paragraphs not yet placed

[KARLETAL1993] suggest that it may be worth considering more precise
technique to calculate DTR (on p1017).


When averaging daily (temperature) values into monthly values, it is
usual to apply some sort of completeness check.  The ideal situation
would be when there are no missing daily values, but requiring this may
lead to the elimination of monthly values when there are in fact enough
daily data to compute a reasonable monthly average. WMO recommends that a
monthly value should not be computed when there are more than 10 missing
days or 5 or more missing consecutively (section 4.8.4 of [WMO100]).
For 30-year normals the stricter 3/5 rule is recommended [WMOTD341]:
no more than 5 missing days and no more than 3 missing consecutively in
any month.

Quality.  5 stations in the UK have clear discrepencies in a
multi-year period in the decade starting in 2001 for the TMIN element.
The remaining UK station does have a long enough period for this
analysis.  Consequently all UK stations in the GSN are discarded from
this analysis.  Brief visual checks of all the stations (temperatures
and anomalies for both TMIN and TMAX) were made; no further stations
were discarded.

While more workers may be choosing to do analyses with daily
data series, it is still the case that due to their simplicitly,
availability, and manageability, some workers may prefer working
with monthly data series.  We urge compilers of monthly data series
to publish (quality controlled) monthly averages of DTR.  This is
the simplest way that workers can avoid the hazard of using TEXS.
Datasets that are compiled primarily from underlying daily data
(USHCN GHCN-M) should be able to do this most easily.
