# A Reminder on how to calculate Diurnal Temperature Range.

## Paragraphs not yet placed

[KARLETAL1993] suggest that it may be worth considering more precise
technique to calculate DTR (on p1017).

Quality.  5 stations in the UK have clear discrepencies in a
multi-year period in the decade starting in 2001 for the TMIN element.
The remaining UK station does have a long enough period for this
analysis.  Consequently all UK stations in the GSN are discarded from
this analysis.  Brief visual checks of all the stations (temperatures
and anomalies for both TMIN and TMAX) were made; no further stations
were discarded.

While more workers may be choosing to do analyses with daily
data series, it is still the case that due to their simplicitly,
availability, and manageability, some workers may prefer working
with monthly data series.  We urge compilers of monthly data series
to publish (quality controlled) monthly averages of DTR.  This is
the simplest way that workers can avoid the hazard of using TEXS.
Datasets that are compiled primarily from underlying daily data
(USHCN GHCND @@) should be able to do this most easily.
