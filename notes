## Notes about the actual investigation

SZ000002220 TMAX 2005-02-12/13 suspect (looks like a missing MINUS sign).

Not very many stations near the equator.

On the whole, the southern hemisphere seems in better shape.

Of the long record stations Mountain stations seem more prone to
error.

In europe, most of the larger DMETs are positive.

Should probably eliminate Amundsen Scott from the analysis.
It's not particular interesting, but it does feature as an
outlier on any scatter that includes elevation, latitude, or
temperature.

A few DMETs are above 200 in magnitude.  EG USW00026615 1949-01

For an example closer to the prime meridian, try TS000060725 1985-03

0 is incorrectly used for missing TMIN.  This grep:

cat data/ghcnd_gsn/*.dly | egrep 'TMIN.*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ].*\b0  [^ ][- ]' | cut -c1-11 | uniq

show 33 stations have 10 or more exact zeroes in some month for TMIN.

Idea: (compare with the duplicate check in [DURREETAL2010]) any 30
day period with 20 or more duplicate values, should flag all of the
duplicate values.

## Procedural Notes

On Annual averages of Temperature Range (for example, see Figure
6 of [KARLETAL1993] for Prague Klementinum-Observatory).  If
Temperature Range has a seasonal component, then a simple
average of all months in a year may be incorrect when the year
has missing months.  Like GISTEMP for temperature, it may be
necessary to go via monthly and seasonal anomalies first.
