## Notes about the actual investigation

Not very many stations near the equator.

On the whole, the southern hemisphere seems in better shape.

Of the long record stations Mountain stations seem more prone to
error.

In europe, most of the larger DMETs are positive.

Should probably eliminate Amundsen Scott from the analysis.
It's not particular interesting, but it does feature as an
outlier on any scatter that includes elevation, latitude, or
temperature.

## Procedural Notes

Should use the WMO 3/5 rule.

On Annual averages of Temperature Range (for example, see Figure
6 of [KARLETAL1993] for Prague Klementinum-Observatory).  If
Temperature Range has a seasonal component, then a simple
average of all months in a year may be incorrect when the year
has missing months.  Like GISTEMP for temperature, it may be
necessary to go via monthly and seasonal anomalies first.
