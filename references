  Could be amusing if i can find it.

  Looks like a pretty thorough survey of DTR in the US, and in
  particular its annual cycle.  Discusses relationship with
  other meteorological elements (such as snow and precipitation),
  which is interesting but not directly applicable to our purpose.
  Uses daily data.  And ancient datasets.

  Looks thorough.  Should read.  Looks like it might use GHCN-M for DTR.

  Defines DTR as monthly TMAX - monthly TMIN.  Quite interesting so far.
  Notable for the assembling of national collections into a dataset
  covering the Northern hemisphere (and a less than representative portion
  of the Southern hemisphere).  Analysis is regional, seasonal, and
  mostly restricted to 1950 onwards (by availability of data).  Discusses
  possible influence of urbanisation, irrigation, and desertification on
  the long term change in Temperature Range.  Regress DTR**0.5 against
  various synoptic climate variables.  The justification for the square
  root (p1017) seems rather hand-wavy (explanatory power goes from 53%
  without square root to 55% with square root.  hah!).  Concludes that
  some changes in DTR may be attributable to cloud cover changes,
  possibly anthropogenic, but more modelling is necessary.

Diurnal temperature range as an index of global climate change during the twentieth century

  probably worth reading.
  Uses monthly Tmin Tmax data, specifically, CRU TS 2.0 (at least, I think
  CRU TS 2.0 is monthly).  Comparison to GCMs.  Land mask for areas with
  reasonable converage.  GCMs do not accurately portray decedal trends
  in DTR.  Possibly cloud modelling is the problem.

  WARNING: I've only got the NOAA summary, not the GRL print or pre-print.
  Short (3 pages).  Data from GHCN-M and GHCN-D, WWR, and a bunch of national collections.
  Mins Maxs and DTRs.  With a nice coverage map.
