  Looks like a pretty thorough survey of DTR in the US, and in
  particular its annual cycle.  Discusses relationship with
  other meteorological elements (such as snow and precipitation),
  which is interesting but not directly applicable to our purpose.
  Uses daily data.  And ancient datasets.

  Looks thorough.  Should read.  Looks like it might use GHCN-M for DTR.

  Defines DTR as monthly TMAX - monthly TMIN.
  Quite interesting so far.
